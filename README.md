# Important Note
By default this userstyle is enabled globally!
This is due to the SPA (single page application) nature of twitch.
Whenenver you click on another channel, twitch updates the url immediately but the actual page transition is delayed.
This means the CSS selector no longer matches rendering this userscript naught.

If you're okay with that behaviour, you can replace `domain("twitch.tv")` with `url-prefix("<INSERT_YOUR_TWITCH_PROFILE_URL>")`
